# Data description

This folder contains data and codes used for plotting the results (Figs. 15 - 19) presented in the paper (Harish, A.B., et.al. (2023) "Mathematics of stable tensegrities", Journal of Theoretical, Computational and Applied Mechanics (Accepted)). This includes:

- Excel sheets with the data
- Matlab codes for plotting the data in the format presented in the paper

## Data in MS Excel

There are two excel books provided in this repository.

- The excel book (*Eigenvalues.xlsx*) contains the eigenvalues for the different eigenmodes of the 9-segrity and 10-segrity plotted in Fig. 15.

- The excel book (*Displacement.xlsx*) contains the nodal coordinates for each rod and string in the two tensegrities. It also shows the nodal displacements for the two tensegrities:
    - For the modes 7, 8 and 9 (without boundary conditions)
    - For the mode 7 (with one-end of the rods fixed)

## Matlab codes



**Note:** The provided plotting codes use an external library *matlab2tikz* in order to save the generated MATLAB figure in vector graphics format. The exact version of the toolbox used has been provided in the folder *matlab2tikz*. This includes their entire repository (including license agreements and source codes).
